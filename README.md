ðŸ“ˆ Predicting Population Growth in Cities
Overview
This project predicts future population growth for different cities using historical population data and statistical or machine learning models.
It provides an interactive visualization of past trends and future projections, helping urban planners, policymakers, and researchers make informed decisions about infrastructure, housing, transportation, and resource allocation.

Features:


City Selection â€“ Choose a city to view its population trend.

Year Range Input â€“ Predict population growth from a given start year to a target year.

Interactive Graphs â€“ Visualize historical and predicted data using line charts.

Model Options â€“ Support for linear regression, polynomial regression, or other forecasting models.

CSV Data Support â€“ Import historical city-wise population data.

Tech Stack
Python â€“ Core programming language

Streamlit â€“ For building the interactive web app

Pandas â€“ Data handling

NumPy â€“ Numerical computations

Matplotlib / Plotly â€“ Data visualization

Scikit-learn â€“ Machine learning models for prediction
